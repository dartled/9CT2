Altered value after second turn from 575 to 550 to prevent robot from going off the edge. Managed to catch red block and yellow block, however after obtaining yellow block, it went too far forward which resulted in the yellow block falling off. After the robot pushed off the yellow block, made a turn that was not 90 degrees (possibly because of the duct tape) and was slightly off to the right which resulted in robot falling off board with red block."
